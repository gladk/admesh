        *  Fix it so that big endian systems write a little endian file
	Also, write null characters after the label in stl_write_binary

        *  Change stl_fill_holes so that duplicate facets are not likely
	to be generated.  Should improve quality of filled holes.

        *  Add support for generating shared vertices
	*  Move fclose(stl->fp) to stl_open()

        *  Don't use area any more to see whether or not the normal should
	be calculated.  Just go ahead and calculate the normal, and let the
	code in stl_normalize vector() take care of the case of a normal 
	with zero area.
	*  Changes call to stl_check_normal_vector() in stl_add_facet() so
	that it doesn't check the normal vector after it adds it.  Just
	caused accounting error for normals fixed.

        *  Initialize normal vector to 0,0,0 when a new facet is added.
