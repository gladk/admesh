To install ADMesh, you will need a system with a c compiler and cmake.
Do the following:

1. Get the file admesh-XXX.tar.gz
2. Extract the archive.  i.e. type something like the following:
      tar -zxvf admesh-XXX.tar.gz
   The source files will be extracted into a directory
3. Create build directory:
      mkdir build
      cd build
4. Type the following:
      cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/INSTALL_PATH/FOR/ADMESH ./../ADMESH_SRC_DIR
      make
      make install

That should do it.  You should have an executable file called admesh in:  
  /INSTALL_PATH/FOR/ADMESH/bin/admesh
